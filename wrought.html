                            <h2>What is "wrought-iron" patio furniture?</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                When shopping for wrought-iron patio furniture it is important to understand that nearly all vintage patio furniture made in the twentieth century takes advantage of what is called "mild steel" material that is mixed with iron and carbon. Mild steel, also known as plain-carbon steel and low-carbon steel, is iron with a particular amount of carbon content, usually between 0.05 â€“ 0.30 percent (versus authentic wrought-iron that retains approximately .8% carbon content). Mild Steel has various properties that make it a dependable alloy, such as low cost, high tensile strength, corrosion resistance, ductility, and more. The term "wrought-iron" is meant to be a trade name representing the type of vintage patio furniture that still retains a mixture of mild steel and iron content that is high enough for the metal to be magnetized. While the term "wrought-iron" is technically a misnomer, all major manufacturers both past and present refer to their product as wrought-iron as long as it has the look, quality and feel of classic wrought-iron.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Aluminum versus mild steel</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                As discussed above, unless a particular set of patio furniture is over a hundred years old, it is most likely mild steel that still retains a high iron content so that the metal will be magnetized.
								The most common type material that gets confused with vintage patio furniture is aluminum furniture. Aluminum furniture is modern and often mixed with other metals because this is a lighter and non-magnetaized material. Most often this type of construction is done outside of the US predominately in Asia. 
                            </p>

                            <h2>Magnet Test</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                The easiest method of determining if a wrought or cast iron piece of furniture is vintage is with a magnet. Simply attach a magnet to chair or table, if it sticks, you have authentic, vintage material. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Weight</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                The weight of the particular piece will also determine whether the majority if not all of the material is vintage material or not. This is a more difficult test since it depends on experience. Generally speaking, any vintage furniture will be much heavier than alumninum or cheaper metals. Again, the vintage material has enough iron in it to magnetize.
                            </p>
                           
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Quality of the Welding</h2> 
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                To keep the furniture free of rust, the best manufactures will weld the intersections of metal components. The circular welds are then sanded and ground to create a smooth transition. Poor quality patio furniture will have shoddy, tough joints that will rust over time.  
                            </p>
                          
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>The comfort test</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                While it is substantial, it is also comfortable. In fact, quality wrought iron furniture is designed with relaxation in mind. Each piece is hand-formed to provide the utmost in comfort, something mass-produced imports cannot come close to matching. 
                            </p>
                           
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Rust versus Corrosion</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                              <img src="../take3planettexas.github.io/images/rustedpatiochair.jpg" alt="">
                            Iron rusts, aluminum corrodes. Aluminum corrosion will often be splotchy and show over a greater surface area of the furniture. Iron rust will most often be isolated and flaky. 
                            </p>
                            
<br>
<br>
                            <h2>Powder Coating versus Painting</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                Powder coating is a method of painting metal parts that uses an electrical charge to make the coating adhere more stongly to the metal. While powder coating is a superior form of coating any metal object, it is often, mistakenly assumed this is the best coating for vintage iron patio furniture. We disagree. One wrought-iron chair can cost as much as $200 to powder coat. Although more difficult to scratch and reveal below surface coloration, it can and does scratch making it cost prohibitive to re-coat everytime this happens. Patio furniture by its nature is meant to be outdoors and endure not only natural extremes, but extremes of usage as well. A better alternative is to use a high-quality, oil based paint that can be easily re-applied to scratches and at a much lower cost.
                            </p>
