						<p class="title_description">
							This page is meant to give you more information on the various types of iron patio furniture that was constructed at or before the mid-century in America. There are a wide assortment of designs and construction techniques that differentiated manufacturers mostly located on the east coast of the United States. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Often people unwittlingly list their own patio sets as authentic wrought or cast iron. A few simple details will help you know for certain you are dealing with authentic mid-century or earlier patio furniture.
<br>
<br>
                            <h2>Is it iron?</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                The most common type material that gets confused with iron patio furniture is aluminum furniture. Aluminum furniture is modern and often mixed with other metals (Alloyed) because this is a cheaper form of construction. Most often this type of construction is done outside of the US predominately in Asia. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Magnet Test</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                The easiest method of determining if a wrought or cast iron piece of furniture is authentic is with a magnet. Simply attach a magnet to chair or table, if it sticks, you have authentic, vintage iron material. Alloyed metal (iron mixed with other metals such as aluminum) is not magnetized and the magnet will not stick.
                            </p>
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Weight</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                The weight of the particular piece will also determine whether the majority if not all of the material is iron or not. This is a more difficult test since it depends on experience. Generally speaking, any iron furniture will be much heavier than alumninum or cheaper metals. 
                            </p>
                           
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Quality of the Welding</h2> 
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                To keep the furniture free of rust, the best manufactures will weld the intersections of iron components. The circular welds are then sanded and ground to create a smooth transition. Poor quality patio furniture will have shoddy, tough joints that will rust over time.  
                            </p>
                          
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>The comfort test</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                While it is substantial, it is also comfortable. In fact, quality wrought iron furniture is designed with relaxation in mind. Each piece is hand-formed to provide the utmost in comfort, something mass-produced imports cannot come close to matching. 
                            </p>
                           
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Rust versus Corrosion</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                              <img src="../take3planettexas.github.io/images/rustedpatiochair.jpg" alt="">
                            Iron rusts, aluminum corrodes. Aluminum corrosion will often be splotchy and show over a greater surface area of the furniture. Iron rust will most often be isolated and flaky. 
                            </p>
                            
<br>
<br>
                            <h2>Powder Coating versus Painting</h2>
                            <p class="wrought_description">
                                Powder coating is a method of painting metal parts that uses an electrical charge to make the coating adhere more stongly to the metal. While powder coating is a superior form of coating any metal object, it is often, mistakenly assumed this is the best coating for vintage iron patio furniture. We disagree. One wrought-iron chair can cost as much as $200 to powder coat. Although more difficult to scratch and reveal below surface coloration, it can and does scratch making it cost prohibitive to re-coat everytime this happens. Patio furniture by its nature is meant to be outdoors and endure not only natural extremes, but extremes of usage as well. A better alternative is to use a high-quality, oil based paint that can be easily re-applied to scratches and at a much lower cost.
                            </p>
